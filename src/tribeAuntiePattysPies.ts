          "Quick thing, our town runs a little stamp challenge for traveling parties. It’s meant to keep groups working together instead of talking past each other. Before you lock in a plan, ask one of your companions what they want to do next or what part they want to take.  |  Stamp Quest (Ask First): Before making a plan, ask another PC what they want to do next or what they want to do for their part in the plan. | Reward: 3 Stamps",
          "Since you look like the capable sort, I’ll share one of our stamp challenges. It rewards teamwork over heroics. Next time trouble starts, set up a simple two-person combo with a companion, nothing fancy, just coordinated.  |  Stamp Quest (Tag-Team): Coordinate a 2-person combo in combat (grapple + shove, distraction + sneak, buff + big hit, etc.). | Reward: 5 Stamps",
          "I’ve got a small stamp challenge that’s been good for keeping parties sharp and in sync. When a companion offers an idea, don’t just agree, add to it. Build on what they said and keep the momentum going.  |  Stamp Quest (Yes, And): Say 'Yes, and-' (or the spirit of it) to another player’s idea and build on it. | Reward: 3 Stamps",
          "Alright, here’s a fun little stamp challenge purely for morale. Pick a light accent or a harmless speech quirk and use it in a couple of conversations  |  Stamp Quest (Tiny Accent): Use a very light accent or speech quirk for two separate conversations. If the DM calls it out, fail. | Reward: 3 Stamps",
          "Hello, dearie. I'm sorry for not being at the door when you came in; these old bones aren't what they used to be. Just give me a moment, and I'll be right there!",

          "Welcome to my little pie shop, every day we have a new granny come and bake a new pie for us to try!",
          "Oh, please don't rob us; the shop right by has way better—oh, sorry. We were robbed a little while ago; guess we're still on edge. Sorry, dearie—how can I help you?",
          "Sometimes we take the pies that are about to expire and hand them out to the crows out back. And sometimes the crows beat up storks and bring us the swaddled babies. I guess that's one way to get grandkids.",
          "Oh my, look how big and strong you are! Say, I could use a good pair of hands like yours. I've got a recipe I've been dying to try! If you'll come in the back, we can get started. All I need from you is a DC 14 Acrobatics check to roll out this dough. If you succeed, I’ll pay you 25 gp. If you fail, you take 1 point of fire damage and I'll pay you 5 gp for your trouble.",
