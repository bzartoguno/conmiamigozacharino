          "Quick thing, our town runs a little stamp challenge for traveling parties. It’s meant to keep groups working together instead of talking past each other. Before you lock in a plan, ask one of your companions what they want to do next or what part they want to take.  |  Stamp Quest (Ask First): Before making a plan, ask another PC what they want to do next or what they want to do for their part in the plan. | Reward: 3 Stamps",
          "Since you look like the capable sort, I’ll share one of our stamp challenges. It rewards teamwork over heroics. Next time trouble starts, set up a simple two-person combo with a companion, nothing fancy, just coordinated.  |  Stamp Quest (Tag-Team): Coordinate a 2-person combo in combat (grapple + shove, distraction + sneak, buff + big hit, etc.). | Reward: 5 Stamps",
          "I’ve got a small stamp challenge that’s been good for keeping parties sharp and in sync. When a companion offers an idea, don’t just agree, add to it. Build on what they said and keep the momentum going.  |  Stamp Quest (Yes, And): Say 'Yes, and-' (or the spirit of it) to another player’s idea and build on it. | Reward: 3 Stamps",
          "Alright, here’s a fun little stamp challenge purely for morale. Pick a light accent or a harmless speech quirk and use it in a couple of conversations  |  Stamp Quest (Tiny Accent): Use a very light accent or speech quirk for two separate conversations. If the DM calls it out, fail. | Reward: 3 Stamps",

          "I used to be a pretty famous adventurer back in the day, but I got bored of saving the day, so now I run this inn to keep me entertained. Hey, that rhymed!",
          "Good old Bestie, my donkey, is out in the stables. Did you know that she actually landed a killing blow on a great purple worm? But now we bring her in to let kids ride on her back. Never saw her that happy when we were out on the road.",
          "Crabs? What crabs? No sirree, no crabs here in this fine establishment. I don't know what you're talking about.",
          "The bad part of getting older is that you become an 'NPC'; the good part is that being an 'NPC' rocks! Nothing like walking down the street with a thought bubble that's just a sandwich you're looking forward to. Protagonism is best left to the teens, young adults, and insane.",
          "Hey kid, come here. I think I just saw a couple of guests try to sneak in some crabs. If you go steal them and hand them to me, I'll 'get rid of them' and make it worth your while. Make a DC 14 Sleight of Hand check. If you succeed, you’ll get paid 25 gp. If you fail, you take 1 point of damage and inspiration (make a reroll on a failed skill check at some point later in time) because maybe grabbing a crab like that wasn't the best idea.",
