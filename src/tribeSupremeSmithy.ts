          "Hey, between you and me, I run a little stamp challenge for regulars. Nothing dangerous, just a bit of fun to keep the road lively.  |  Stamp Quest (Wild Animal): Subtly make animal sounds into conversations, loud enough for the person beside you to hear you, but if you get caught by the ‘DM’, you fail this quest. | Reward: At the session's end, earn stamps equal to the number of animal sounds you successfully make.",
          "I like adventurers who travel as a team, not a parade. Here’s a small stamp challenge I hand out to folks I’m rooting for. Next time, you could take charge, pass the lead to someone else and let them shine.  |  Stamp Quest (Share the Spotlight): When you could take the lead, deliberately hand it to another PC (“You’re better at this than me, you take it.”). | Reward: 4 Stamps",
          "Most people come in here looking for gear, but the smart ones invest in their companions. I’ve got a stamp challenge for that kind of traveler. Help one of your party members make real progress on something personal they’re chasing this session.  |  Stamp Quest (Helping Hand): Help another party member with their personal goal this session. | Reward: 10 Stamps",
          "I don’t like seeing heroes go without when their friends could help. So here’s a little stamp challenge, nice and simple. If a companion’s talking about buying something helpful, surprise them by covering it or gifting them something valuable.  |  Stamp Quest (It’s dangerous to go alone): Give another party member a useful item like a potion, weapon, armor, or a few coins when they are talking about buying an item. | Reward: 3 Stamps",
          "It's hard being the oldest son in the Redrockson family. Will and Pat took up dance lessons, Goldhand played with dolls, and Nex couldn't stop eating dirt. So I had to be their shield to protect them from the bullies.",
          "Do I have any dirt on my younger brothers? Of course I do! But am I going to let you pick on them? Over my dead body!",
          "I know my brothers don't mention it too much, but the reason why we are all running our business is because, way back home, Ma and Pa are in some serious debt. Raising five riled-up dwarf boys on top of dealing with dwarven petrifaction is no easy feat. So to make up for it, me and the lads are setting up Ma and Pa for the rest of their lives, with each one of us taking turns to go see them so they won't get too lonely.",
          "Everything you see here, I sell it for 3 gold above cost, because it’s better to have protection than not.",
          "Welcome to Supreme Smithy, having some armor is better then no armor.",
          "Blasted long-limbed—oh, sorry, didn't see you there. Hey, you're pretty lanky; would you mind giving me a hand? A customer came in and claimed that their armor was too short. I just finished reworking it, and you look about the same size, so try it on and give me a few stretches, yeah? Make a DC 14 Athletics check. If you succeed, Sam will pay you 25 gp. If you fail, you take 1 point of damage, slight embarrassment, as you ripped the new stitches and get 20 gp.",
