          "Hey, between you and me, I run a little stamp challenge for regulars. Nothing dangerous, just a bit of fun to keep the road lively.  |  Stamp Quest (Wild Animal): Subtly make animal sounds into conversations, loud enough for the person beside you to hear you, but if you get caught by the ‘DM’, you fail this quest. | Reward: At the session's end, earn stamps equal to the number of animal sounds you successfully make.",
          "I like adventurers who travel as a team, not a parade. Here’s a small stamp challenge I hand out to folks I’m rooting for. Next time, you could take charge, pass the lead to someone else and let them shine.  |  Stamp Quest (Share the Spotlight): When you could take the lead, deliberately hand it to another PC (“You’re better at this than me, you take it.”). | Reward: 4 Stamps",
          "Most people come in here looking for gear, but the smart ones invest in their companions. I’ve got a stamp challenge for that kind of traveler. Help one of your party members make real progress on something personal they’re chasing this session.  |  Stamp Quest (Helping Hand): Help another party member with their personal goal this session. | Reward: 10 Stamps",
          "I don’t like seeing heroes go without when their friends could help. So here’s a little stamp challenge, nice and simple. If a companion’s talking about buying something helpful, surprise them by covering it or gifting them something valuable.  |  Stamp Quest (It’s dangerous to go alone): Give another party member a useful item like a potion, weapon, armor, or a few coins when they are talking about buying an item. | Reward: 3 Stamps",
          "Yes, yes, this is where we do oracle readings.",
          "You know, my great-great-grandmother wanted to live forever, so she went and stole her hourglass from a time goddess. But when the goddess found out, she cursed her and her following children to always be entwined with time. My curse? Well, it's the fact that one eye can always see into the future and the other into the past of any object I'm looking at. Though, apparently, my great-great-granddaughter time-travels back to her era every calendar year and spends her time with me.",
          "I thought you might be stopping in. Have you time to play a game with an old man like me? If not, I completely understand.",
          "Umm I thought I put my reading glasses right here, I guess not. Silly old me.",
          "I don't mind running this shop just that sometimes it can get so lonely in here, but enough about me! How can I help you?",
          "Oh rats, I just saw that a noble is coming for a reading. They'll probably want it to look all fancy. MMMmm. Say, would you be willing to help me pull out the more esoteric blankets and curtains and hang them up to give this place a much more 'ominous vibe,' as the kids say? Make a DC 14 Religion check to help me sort these. If you succeed, I’ll pay you an inspiration (make a reroll on a failed skill check at some point later in time). If you fail, you get overwhelmed and take 1 point of psychic damage.",
