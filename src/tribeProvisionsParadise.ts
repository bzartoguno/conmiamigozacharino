          "Quick thing, our town runs a little stamp challenge for traveling parties. It’s meant to keep groups working together instead of talking past each other. Before you lock in a plan, ask one of your companions what they want to do next or what part they want to take.  |  Stamp Quest (Ask First): Before making a plan, ask another PC what they want to do next or what they want to do for their part in the plan. | Reward: 3 Stamps",
          "Since you look like the capable sort, I’ll share one of our stamp challenges. It rewards teamwork over heroics. Next time trouble starts, set up a simple two-person combo with a companion, nothing fancy, just coordinated.  |  Stamp Quest (Tag-Team): Coordinate a 2-person combo in combat (grapple + shove, distraction + sneak, buff + big hit, etc.). | Reward: 5 Stamps",
          "I’ve got a small stamp challenge that’s been good for keeping parties sharp and in sync. When a companion offers an idea, don’t just agree, add to it. Build on what they said and keep the momentum going.  |  Stamp Quest (Yes, And): Say 'Yes, and-' (or the spirit of it) to another player’s idea and build on it. | Reward: 3 Stamps",
          "Alright, here’s a fun little stamp challenge purely for morale. Pick a light accent or a harmless speech quirk and use it in a couple of conversations  |  Stamp Quest (Tiny Accent): Use a very light accent or speech quirk for two separate conversations. If the DM calls it out, fail. | Reward: 3 Stamps",
